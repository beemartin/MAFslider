gbandslopes.dat/ubandslopes.dat:
	data files containing the slope of parallactic offset vs. the tangent of the zenith angle at a given redshift

MAFthumbs:
	folder containing thumbnail images of skymaps from the maf.  Organized by redshift and band, respectively.  

Slopeslider.ipynb:
	jupyter notebook of the skymaps alongside the slope of parallactic offset v. tangent of zenith angle.  Use the slider to view different redshifts.

deepdrill-g/u-medianbayes.dat:
	data files containing the median bayes factor for the deep drilling fields in the g and u bands respectively.  NOTE:  In the u-band, values of 1e+292 are used as a placeholder for numbers too big for the slider to handle.  These do not reflect acurately the actual values of the bayes factor in these redshifts.

ecliptic-g-medianbayes.dat:
	data file containing the median bayes factor for the ecliptic spur region.  NOTE: Unlike the other regions, there is only one data file for this region, as the ecliptic spur is not present in the u-band.

galaxband-g/u-medianbayes.dat:
	data files containing the median bayes factor for the galactic band region in the g and u bands.

galaxpole-g/u-medianbayes.dat:
	data files containing the median bayes factor for the galactic pole region in the g and u bands.

main-g/u-medianbayes.dat:
	data files containing the median bayes factor for the main survey region in the g and u bands.

Medianslider.ipynb:
	jupyter notebook of the skymaps alongside the median bayes factor in different regions on the sky.  Use the slider to view different redshifts. 

To Run:
	in terminal: type "jupyter notebook Slopeslider.ipynb" for the slope display version
		     type "jupyter notebook Medianslider.ipynb" for the median bayes display version
